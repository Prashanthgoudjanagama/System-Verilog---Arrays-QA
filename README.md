# System-Verilog---Arrays-QA
This repository explores SystemVerilog Arrays, including fixed-size arrays, dynamic arrays, associative arrays, and queues. It provides detailed explanations, example codes, and practical use cases for efficient hardware design and verification.

# Key Features:
    1. Overview of different SystemVerilog array types. 
    2. Code examples with explanations.
    3. Common QA (Questions & Answers) for better understanding.
    4. Best practices for efficient coding in SystemVerilog.
    
# Usage:
Clone the repo and explore the SystemVerilog examples to strengthen your HDL skills and debugging techniques.
